# energy-based-planning
An energy-based planner prompt based on [Ruri Ohama's work.](https://youtu.be/WW8M9SbMTeE?si=CtbIwn_PVYaH-c02). 

Load this prompt and return to it throughout the week to plan your day in the morning and shut down after work in the evening. On Fridays, export your sprints, then load them into a new prompt Monday.
